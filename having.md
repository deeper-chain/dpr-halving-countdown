# Second Ever DPR Mining Halving Event

Dear Deeper Network Community,

There is important news about the progress of our decentralized ecosystem, which reflects our community's exceptional efforts and the growing success of our network initiatives! As of today, the total circulating supply of DPR tokens has reached 1.9 billion DPR, bringing us closer to the 20 billion DPR milestone. This marks an important juncture in our journey as the next DPR mining halving event is now imminent.

## Accelerated Halving Timeline

Our mining halving mechanism is designed to maintain the long-term sustainability and value of DPR tokens by reducing the issuance rate with every 10 billion DPR mined. While the initial projections estimated that each halving would occur approximately every three years, our community's robust participation—through increased mining activity and network engagement—has accelerated the timeline, enabling the network to reach this milestone ahead of schedule.

This demonstrates the strength of our ecosystem, as evidenced by:
- The continued increase in active miners
- Consistent growth in network traffic
- The expansion of our global user base
- The unwavering support of our global community

Based on current mining rates, we anticipate the next halving to occur in approximately 23 days. You can track the current total DPR issuance through the Deeper Chain Mainnet Explorer for real-time updates.

## Key Details of the Halving Event

- **Expected Date**: The halving is projected to occur once the 20 billion DPR milestone is achieved, which is anticipated within the coming weeks based on current mining rates.
- **New Mining Rewards**: Following the halving, the mining rewards for contributors will be reduced by 50%, aligning with our tokenomics model.

## Mining Rewards Comparison

To help our community understand the upcoming changes, below is a detailed comparison of the mining reward structures before and after the halving event. The DPR requirements for each level will remain unchanged, while the APY rates will be adjusted as follows:

| Level | Current APY | Post-Halving APY | DPR Required |
|-------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| Zero  | 0%          | 0%              | 0            |
| One   | 10%         | 5%              | 5,000        |
| Two   | 15%         | 7.5%            | 10,000       |
| Three | 18%         | 9%              | 20,000       |
| Four  | 20%         | 10%             | 35,000       |
| Five  | 23%         | 11.5%           | 50,000       |
| Six   | 25%         | 12.5%           | 60,000       |
| Seven | 28%         | 14%             | 80,000       |
| Eight | 30%         | 15%             | 100,000      |

## Impact on the Ecosystem

The halving process is a seamless, automated adjustment embedded in our blockchain protocol, leveraging smart contracts to ensure precise and transparent reward adjustments, thereby reinforcing trust and operational efficiency within the network. It will have no direct impact on the functionality of the network or the mining process itself.

This serves as a proactive measure to:

1. **Maintain DPR's Intrinsic Value**: By reducing token issuance, the supply-demand balance is preserved, fostering a stable and resilient ecosystem.
2. **Incentivize Long-Term Growth**: The halving mechanism underpins our commitment to sustainable growth by prioritizing value over volume.
3. **Strengthen the Community's Role**: The accelerated halving reflects the active engagement and contributions of our miners, users, and stakeholders.

## Looking Ahead

As we approach this pivotal event, we remain focused on delivering continued value to our ecosystem. The Deeper Network team will provide timely updates and resources to ensure our community is well-informed and prepared for the transition. Your understanding, participation, and support are critical as we advance into this next phase of our roadmap.
